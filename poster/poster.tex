\block{Course description}{
This course will focus on the parallel implementation of computational mathematics problems using modern accelerated C++. The aim of this course is to learn how to quickly write useful efficient C++ programs. The students will not learn low-level C/C++ instead they will learn how to use high-level data structures, iterators, generic strings, and streams (including interactive and file I/O) of the C++ ISO Standard library. In addition, highly-optimized linear algebra libraries are introduced since the course teaches to solve problems, instead of explaining low-level C++and computer science algorithms, like sorting algorithms, which are provided in the C++ standard library.\\


The first part, provides a brief overview of the containers, strings, streams, input/output, and the numeric library of the C++ standard library. For linear algebra, we will look into Blaze which is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library for dense and sparse arithmetic.The second part will solve computational mathematics problems based-on the the previous introduced features of the C++ standard library.The third part will focus on the parallel features provided by the C++ standard library. Here,the implemented computational problems in the second part of the course will be parallized using the C++ standard library for parallelism and concurrency.Since programming skills can only be improved by doing, there will be weekly programming exercises and a small project. After this course students have a basic overview of the C++ standard library to solve efficiently computational mathematics problems without using low-level C/C++.
