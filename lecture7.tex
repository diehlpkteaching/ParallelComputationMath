\begin{frame}{Definition of parallelism}

\begin{itemize}
\item We need multiple resources which can operate at the same time
\item We have to have more than one task that can be performed at the same time
\item We have to do multiple tasks on multiple resources the same time
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Amdahl's Law (Strong scaling)~\cite{amdahl1967validity}}

\begin{align*}
S = \frac{1}{(1-P) + \frac{P}{N}}
\end{align*}
where $S$ is the speed up, $P$ the proportion of parallel code, and $N$ the numbers of threads.

\begin{block}{Example}
A program took 20 hours using a single thread and only the part took one hour can be run in parallel, we will get $P=0.95$. So the theoretical speed up is $\frac{1}{(1-0.95)}=20$.

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Parallel algorithms in C++ 17\footnote{\tiny\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/parallelism}}}
\begin{itemize}
\item C++17 added support for parallel algorithms to the standard library, to help programs take advantage of parallel execution for improved performance.
\item Parallelized versions of 69 algorithms from \lstinline|<algorithm>|, \lstinline|<numeric>| and \lstinline|<memory>| are available. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Recently new feature!}
Only recently released compilers (gcc 9 and MSVC 19.14)\footnote{\tiny\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support}} implement these new features and some of them are still experimental.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Some special compiler flags are needed to use these features:

The algorithm is executed sequential, like \lstinline|std::accumulate| in the previous example and using only once thread.
\item \lstinline|std::execution::par| \\
The algorithm is executed in parallel and used multiple threads.
\item \lstinline| std::execution::par_unseq| \\
The algorithm is executed in parallel and vectorization is used.

\section{Be aware of: Data races and Dead looks}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Be aware of}

\begin{center}
With great power comes great responsibility!

\end{center}


\begin{block}{You are responsible}
When using parallel execution policy, it is the programmer's responsibility to avoid
\begin{itemize}
\item data races
\item race conditions
\item deadlocks
\end{itemize} 
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Data race}

\begin{lstlisting}
//Compute the sum of the array a in parallel
int a[] = {0,1};
int sum = 0;
std::for_each(std::execution::par, 
              std::begin(a), 
              std::end(a), [&](int i) {
  sum += a[i]; // Error: Data race
});
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{block}{Data race:}
A data race exists when multithreaded (or otherwise parallel) code that would access a shared resource could do so in such a way as to cause unexpected results.
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Solution I: data races}

\begin{block}{\lstinline|std::atomic|\footnote{\tiny\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic}}}
\begin{lstlisting}
//Compute the sum of the array a in parallel
int a[] = {0,1};
std::atomic<int> sum{0};
std::for_each(std::execution::par, 
              std::begin(a), 
              std::end(a), [&](int i) {
  sum += a[i]; 
});
\end{lstlisting}
\end{block}

The atomic library\footnote{\tiny\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic}} provides components for fine-grained atomic operations allowing for lockless concurrent programming. Each atomic operation is indivisible with regards to any other atomic operation that involves the same object. Atomic objects are free of data races. 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Solution 2: data races}
\begin{block}{\lstinline|std::mutex|\footnote{\tiny\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex}}}
\begin{lstlisting}
//Compute the sum of the array a in parallel
int a[] = {0,1};
int sum = 0;
std::mutex m;
std::for_each(std::execution::par, 
              std::begin(a), 
              std::end(a), [&](int i) {
  m.lock();
  sum += a[i];
  m.unlock(); 
});
\end{lstlisting}
\end{block}
The mutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads. 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Race condition}

\begin{lstlisting}

if (x == 5)  // Checking x
{
   // Different thread could change x 
      
   y = x * 2; // Using x
}
// It is not sure if y is 10 or any other value.
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{block}{Race condition}
A check of a shared variable within a parallel execution and another thread could change this variable before it is used.
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Solution: Race condition}


\begin{lstlisting}
std::mutex m;

m.lock();
if (x == 5)  // Checking x
{
   // Different thread could change x 
      
   y = x * 2; // Using x
}
m.unlock();
// Now it is sure that y will be 10
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{block}{Race condition}
A check of a shared variable within a parallel execution and another thread could change this variable before it is used.
\end{block}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Deadlocks}
Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other.

\begin{block}{Example (Taken from\footnote{\tiny{\url{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/deadlock.html}}})}
Alphonse and Gaston are friends, and great believers in courtesy. A strict rule of courtesy is that when you bow to a friend, you must remain bowed until your friend has a chance to return the bow. Unfortunately, this rule does not account for the possibility that two friends might bow to each other at the same time.
