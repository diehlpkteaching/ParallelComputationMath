\section{Parallelism}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Parallel algorithms in C++ 17\footnote{\tiny\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/parallelism}}}
\begin{itemize}
\item C++17 added support for parallel algorithms to the standard library, to help programs take advantage of parallel execution for improved performance.
\item Parallelized versions of 69 algorithms from \lstinline|<algorithm>|, \lstinline|<numeric>| and \lstinline|<memory>| are available. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Recently new feature!}
Only recently released compilers (gcc 9 and MSVC 19.14) implement these new features and some of them are still experimental.\\
\vspace{0.5cm}
Some special compiler flags are needed to use these features:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
g++ -std=c++1z -ltbb lecture7-loops.cpp 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Example: Accumulate}

\begin{lstlisting}
std::vector<int> nums(1000000,0);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{block}{Sequential\footnote{\tiny\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/accumulate}}}
\begin{lstlisting}
auto result = std::accumulate(nums.begin(), 
                              nums.end(),
                              0.0);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Parallel\footnote{\tiny\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/reduce}}}
\begin{lstlisting}
auto result = std::reduce(
              std::execution::par,
              nums.begin(), nums.end());
\end{lstlisting}
\end{block}

Important: \lstinline|std::execution::par| from \lstinline|#include<execution>|\footnote{\tiny\url{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/execution_policy_tag}}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{Execution time}

\begin{block}{Time measurements}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
g++ -std=c++1z -ltbb lecture7-loops.cpp 
./a.out
std::accumulate result 0.000000 took 8164.458818 ms
std::reduce result 0.000000 took 584.451218 ms
\end{lstlisting}


\end{block}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Execution policies}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Execution policies}

\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline|std::execution::seq| \\
The algorithm is executed sequential, like \lstinline|std::accumulate| in the previous example and using only once thread.
\item \lstinline|std::execution::par| \\
The algorithm is executed in parallel and used multiple threads.
\item \lstinline| std::execution::par_unseq| \\
The algorithm is executed in parallel and vectorization is used.
\end{itemize}
Note we will not cover vectorization in this course. \\
