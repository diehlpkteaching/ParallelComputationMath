\begin{frame}[fragile]{About BlazeIterative\footnote{\tiny\url{https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/BlazeIterative}}}
This is a set of iterative linear system solvers intended for use with the Blaze library, a high-performance C++ linear algebra library. The API is currently based on a tag-dispatch system to choose a particular algorithm.

\begin{block}{Usage}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
#Install
tar -xvf blaze_iterative.gz
cd blaze_iterative
cp -r ./blaze_iterative /home/patrick/

#Compile
g++ -I/home/diehlpk/blaze 
    -I/home/patrick/blaze_iterative BlazeTest.cpp
\end{lstlisting}
\end{block}


\end{frame}

\begin{lstlisting}
#include "BlazeIterative.hpp"

using namespace blaze;
using namespace blaze::iterative;

std::size_t N = 10;
DynamicMatrix<double,false> A(N,N, 0.0);
DynamicVector<double> b(N, 0.0);
DynamicVector<double> x1(N, 0.);

//Initialize the matrix

// Solve the system
ConjugateGradientTag tag;
auto x2 = solve(A,b,tag);

\end{lstlisting}
